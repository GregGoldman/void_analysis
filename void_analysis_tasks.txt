void_finder project issues:
------------------------------
x = done
~ = progress

[x]	limit the use of cell arrays in general
[~]	improve commenting of the code
[~]	split up large functions into their own files, have helper functions
[x]	update functionality to find vv and vt (averaging of points)


[]	include examples

	
[]	improve the structure of the findPeaks code

[]	update the nearestNeighbor code and find an example of the old bug
[]	add examples of points of interest in the code
[]	create plots of vv and vt



[]	deal with the resets (finding the magnitudes is not currently working -- need to 		string together the data so that the resests simply do not show up)
[]	talk to danielle about various points of interest in the data
[]	merge together groups which are very close
[]	finish/fix code which pairs algorithm points with user points
[]	eventually show the distributions of the features(far down the line)
[]	interface for working with the data
[]	fix glitches and jumps (string together the data appropriately) (probably do this sooner rather than later)

[]	compareUserCpt() is not working very well at the moment...



[]	plot GUI!
