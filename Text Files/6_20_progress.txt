6_20_progress

Got a lot further with the GUI yesterday. Goal for today is to make improvements there with organization, finishing the callback functions, and saving defaults.

TODO:
save defaults
fix startup stuff ("would you like to select bad data" needs to be dealt with differently)
allow for different sorting types w/ selector (get into statistical similarity)
deal with voids that are really close to other voids and write code to deal with that
when you click a marker, make that the current marker
