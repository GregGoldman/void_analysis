Project timeline:
Today's date: 6/13/2017

Weekly Goals:
Week 1: 6/5 - 6/9 [x]
[x]	Worked on processing of files, structure of code...

Week 2: 5/12 - 5/16
[x]	Improve algorithm, start comparing to 'ground truth' data
		Top priority--the algorithm still needs substantial work (seems from comparing with other trials...)
			consider a convolution????

[x]	fix the comparison code (bug from yesterday)
[]	create plots of vv and vt
[x]	add examples/points of interest in the code
[x]	Talk to Danielle about various points in the data/past trials
[x]	find ways to correct the resets/evaporations and the glitches in the data
[]	merge voids which are very close toghether
[]	(by end of Friday) mostly successful algorithm
[x]	really carefully go through the finding pairs function to make sure it works properly...
[x]	*something about the timing is just not quite right...



	QUESTION: is it worth trying to get the slopes around all of the voids and find the point where the intersection is? will that improve the timing substantially?


Week 3:5/19 - 5/23
[]	Work on the user interface, figure out saving 
[]	design GUI
[]	finished GUI (more or less)

Week 4: 5/26 - 5/30
[]	Testing period, get feedback
[]	work on writing back to notocord files?
