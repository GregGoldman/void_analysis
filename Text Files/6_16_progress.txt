Algorithm is pretty successful. There are usually a few points which get mixed up, but it hardly every misses any data points, usualy is only a little off or has too many. Often it is becuase the threshold for what is a void is not always clear depending on the trial. 

Most points which are missed are near something which has already been marked as an odd area of data (i.e. a spike or other glitch). 

improved the accuracy of start markers by iteratively analyzing slope. Also improved removal of solid voiding events vs liquid. Able to mark which ones are too close together for adjustment.
